  During the pandemic, I decided to extend my knowledge in Technolgy. I have always been passionate about programming and technology, therefore I acquired a Coding certificate from Tecnologico de Monterrey. Having an Accounting and Finance background, I worked in the past as an Auditor and Consultant in different areas of global, international and domestic organizations. Having contributed to global projects were business and operational processes were outsourced, aside of Compliance, Process Simplification and Automation was a must.                                                         
   
  Often worked with teams using Agile and Scrum methodologies. I have contributed with the creation of dashboards and databases for data analysis and manipulation. Now my focus is to continue to grow as a Full Stack Web Developer.`,
